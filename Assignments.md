# JavaScript React Intro Assignments

# Ex. 1: Dollar Food Store
The React Component is our building block when creating React applications.  We need to know how to architect/structure our React web pages using simple React components.

Create the following React [Type 1](https://gitlab.com/mburolla/javascript-react-starter/-/blob/main/component-types.md) components for this [HTML](./src/TODO/index.html) and [CSS](./src/TODO/style.css):

- Menu
    - Food
    - Drink
    - Dessert
- Footer

The `Header` React component has been done for you.  It can be used as an example for the rest of the React components.

When you are finished, the Main React component will resemble the following and will produce the rendered output below:

```
<div className="Main">
    <Header />
    <Menu />
    <Footer />
</div>
```
